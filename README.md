# UnoFlip
AUTHORS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

This program reproduces a simplified version of the card game UNO Flip. This program was made for the SYSC 3110 team project, by group 15, which consists of Khalid Merai, Scharara Islam, Marina Latif and Abdulrahman Aldayel.

How to Play UNO using the console interface:
1. Run the Class Main
2. Enter the number of Players : (2-4)
3. Enter the name of Players
4. The game will display the top card on the discard pile, and each player's initial hand.
5. You can choose to draw a card (enter 0) or play a card (enter 1) when prompted
   -> if you choose to draw a card (enter 0), the game will simulate drawing a card from the deck and add it to your hand.
   -> If you choose to play a card (enter 1), you will be prompted to enter the index of the card you want to play from your hand. After playing the card, the game will update the top 
      card on the discard pile, and it will be the next player's turn.
6. Repeat step 5 for each player's turn. The game will continue until a player wins by emptying their hand.


Game Rules
Uno has a few simple rules:

1. Players take turns playing a card that matches the color or number of the top card in the discard pile.
2. Special cards, such as Wild cards, Reverse, Skip, and Draw Two cards, have unique effects.
3. When you have one card left, you must say "Uno" to alert the other players.
4. The first player to play all their cards wins the game.
